The file size of sources/alice29.txt is:
152089 Bytes.
The entropy is:
Markov source of order k = 0:  H(Xi,...,Xi+k) = 4.56768
Markov source of order k = 1:  H(Xi,...,Xi+k) = 6.31416
Markov source of order k = 2:  H(Xi,...,Xi+k) = 7.03569
This gives:
Markov source of order k = 0:  H(Xi) = 4.56768
Markov source of order k = 1:  H(Xi|Xi-k) = 1.74648
Markov source of order k = 2:  H(Xi|Xi-1, Xi-k) = 0.721537
